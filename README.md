### Hello!

While you might prefer to read about me on my website [Intense Minimalism](https://intenseminimalism.com/), here you can still find all my public code if you are curious. Lots of it goes all the way back to 2006 or so, when this account started some of the libraries and code I released. 

The biggest open source project I co-founded — Baker Framework — is not here as it was a shared project and later [we left](https://intenseminimalism.com/2013/bakers-future-say-hello-to-the-new-project-lead/) it to a [new owner from the community](https://github.com/bakerframework). It's something that was quite successful at the time, and makes me very proud as it creates its own open source community.
